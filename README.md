# Description
Setup a DVR/Live TV Tuner in plex media server. I used a VU+ Zeor 4K<br />
The guide is what i have done in a couple of hours on a sunday evening, and not a 1:1 copy/pasta installation walktrough.
<br /><br />
Live TV in plex is a nightmare. <br />
Especillay the EPG(XMLTV) crap...<br /><br />
But this solution has the advantage that you can use CI encrypted channels.<br />
Which is with the most (and suported tuner from plex) not possible.

# Note
This "guide" was to archive and document the installation progress of all kind of things.<br />
Because in a couple of years/months i cant rember what i have done, and perhaps i need in the future again.

## TL;DR

- Unwrap / put all cables in
